# üí´ About Me:
I am a passionate and driven Computer Science student at **Northern Kentucky University** with a Minor in Mathematics and a strong academic record (**GPA: 3.97**). With over four years of coding experience, I specialize in full-stack development and software engineering, with a keen interest in building user-centric, scalable, and impactful applications.  

My technical toolkit includes **Java, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Spring Boot, Vue.js**, and various database technologies. I enjoy working across the stack ‚Äî from crafting intuitive frontends to developing robust backend systems. I also thrive in research-oriented environments, where I‚Äôve contributed to projects combining technology with human-computer interaction and data visualization.  

Eager to continuously learn and collaborate, I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and building solutions that make a difference. Currently, I‚Äôm honing my skills further as an **Extreme Programming Intern at Great American Insurance Group**, where I work on enterprise-level software in a fast-paced, feedback-driven team.
