# üí´ About Me

Hi there! I'm **Bhuwan Bhandari**, a passionate and driven **Computer Science** student at **Northern Kentucky University**, minoring in **Mathematics** with a stellar **GPA of 3.97**. With over four years of hands-on coding experience and a strong foundation in both theory and practice, I specialize in **full-stack development**, **backend engineering**, and **human-centered software design**.

I thrive at the intersection of **technology, design, and collaboration**, building applications that are not only functional but also intuitive and scalable. My technical toolkit includes:

- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, Node.js, C/C++, Python, PHP, SQL  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Spring Boot, React, Vue.js, Redux, Zustand, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap  
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, AWS (EC2), MongoDB, REST APIs, JWT, WebSockets, JUnit, Playwright  

Currently, I‚Äôm sharpening my software engineering skills as an **Extreme Programming Intern** at **Great American Insurance Group**, where I build enterprise-level access review tools, collaborate in a test-driven and pair-programming culture, and modernize legacy systems using **Spring Boot**, **Vue.js**, and **Oracle DB**.

I‚Äôm a big believer in **clean code, continuous learning, and collaborative development**. Whether I‚Äôm building real-time collaboration tools or visualizing complex data, I approach every challenge with curiosity and precision.
